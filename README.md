# js-checkers
A game of checkers implemented in Javascript 

I've been using jsfiddle to develop this version of checkers. It's simple in that it doesn't use really fancy graphics and just lets you move the pieces around acording to the rules.

More than a few of the rules aren't implemented yet, like kings and double jumps.
